    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Cut the chicken breasts or thighs into pentagon shapes (or any fun geometric shapes).</li>
        <li>In a shallow bowl, beat the eggs with a fork or whisk.</li>
        <li>In another shallow bowl, mix together the flour, breadcrumbs, salt, black pepper, garlic powder, paprika, and chili powder (if using).</li>
        <li>Dip each piece of chicken first in the egg mixture, coating it completely.</li>
        <li>Then, dip the chicken in the breadcrumb mixture, making sure to coat it evenly on all sides.</li>
        <li>Heat about 1 inch of oil in a large skillet or pot over medium-high heat.</li>
        <li>Fry the breaded chicken pieces in batches, ensuring not to overcrowd the pan, until golden brown and cooked through (about 2-3 minutes per side).</li>
        <li>Remove the fried chicken from the oil and place on a wire rack or paper towel-lined plate to drain excess oil.</li>
        <li>Serve the pentagon chicken hot, with your favorite dipping sauces or garnishes.</li>
    </ol>
